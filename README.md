# tscharts-chart

Android UI used to search for patients and access medical charts at a 
Thousand Smiles clinic.

This project is derived from the deprecated tscharts-station app at 
https://github.com/slogan621/tscharts-station. It provides a non-scheduler 
based way to access patient charts, less complicated to manage and easier
to train volunteers to use.

# Overview

application interfaces.
